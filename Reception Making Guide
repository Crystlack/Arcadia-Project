3) Name it however you want
   Make sure "Place solution and project in the same directory" is turned ON
   .NET Framework 4.8
4) At the top of the window open Project -> (proect-name) Properties -> Build Events
5) Under "post-build events" add the following line "COPY /Y $(TargetPath) $(SolutionDir)\..\DLLs"
   DO NOT MAKE ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THIS LINE
   ALSO, DO *NOT* COPY THE QUOTATION MARKS (")
